# CodingConventionsCop
This is a Visual Studio 2015 extension to make sure our projects follow the coding conventions.

Inspired by [C# Essentials](https://github.com/DustinCampbell/CSharpEssentials).

It make sure the following coding conventions:
- One source file has only one type declaration.
- The name of an awaitable method should end with **Async** suffix.
